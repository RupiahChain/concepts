# RupiahChain White Paper
RupiahChain is an application for exchanging Cryptocurrencies to Paper Money or vice versa from Banknotes to Cryptocurrencies Anonymously. No KYC and no transaction limits.

## Problems
Withdrawing and depositing money from cryptocurrencies to bank accounts or digital wallets and vice versa is very difficult. We have to make a withdrawal or deposit through the exchange exchange. Safe, even though many exchange sites are closed unilaterally and freeze customer funds. Even though it's safe, it's not anonymous, because we submit all of our data, starting from the name, date of birth, even the names of several exchanges asking for KYC identity cards and facial biometrics. We require anonymous withdrawals or deposits. We don't want my personal data, my identity card, my biometric data to be at stake for any uncertainty.

## Solutions
Here we create decentralized finance, where every individual can withdraw and deposit money from cryptocurrency to a bank or digital wallet, and vice versa. There is no handover of personal data such as favorite food, mother's name, date of birth, photo ID, or even biometric data.

```
Cryptocurrency --> RupiahChain --> Paper Money
or
Paper Money --> RupiahChain --> Cryptocurrency
```

We support multiple blockchains, multiple digital wallets, and multiple banks for fiat money payment methods. All our transactions are **instant & automatic**, and yes we are open 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.

## Project & Defense Plans
We believe this project will last a long time. As long as people value their privacy and cryptocurrencies are still in use. During that time the project will continue.
